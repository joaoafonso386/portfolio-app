# Portfolio-app

My first project made with Angular!

After learning all the basics about front-end, the task of my full-stack web development course was to create my first front-end project. I decided to use Angular and build an application that resembled my learning experience, my working experience and myself!

I'm extremely proud of this project as it was very challenging. It made me get out of the comfort zone to improve even more. The journey now continues to the back-end!
